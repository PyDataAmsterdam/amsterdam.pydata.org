Phenomenon is a very small, low-level WebGL library that provides the essentials to deliver a high performance experience. Its core functionality is built around the idea of moving *millions of particles* around using the power of the GPU.

#### Features:

- Small in size, no dependencies
- GPU based for high performance
- Low-level & highly configurable
- Helper functions with options
- Add & destroy instances dynamically
- Dynamic attribute switching

## Install

```
$ npm install --save phenomenon
```

## Usage

```js
// Import the library
import Phenomenon from 'phenomenon';

// Create a renderer
const phenomenon = new Phenomenon(options);

// Add an instance
phenomenon.add("particles", options);
```

## API

### Phenomenon(options)

Returns an instance of Phenomenon.

> Throughout this documentation we'll refer to an instance of this as `renderer`.

#### options.canvas
Type: `HTMLElement` <br/>
Default: `document.querySelector('canvas')` <br/>

The element where the scene, with all of its instances, will be rendered to. The provided element has to be `<canvas>` otherwise it won't work.

#### options.context
Type: `Object`<br/>
Default: `{}`<br/>

Overrides that are used when getting the WebGL context from the canvas. The library overrides two settings by default.

| Name      | Default | Description                                                                                                                             |
| --------- | --------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alpha     | `false` | Setting this property to `true` will result in the canvas having a transparent background. By default clearColor is used instead.   |
| Antialias | `false` | Setting this property to `true` will make the edges sharper, but could negatively impact performance. See for yourself if it's worth it! |

> Read more about all the possible overrides on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext">MDN</a>.

#### options.contextType
Type: `String` <br/>
Default: `webgl`

The context identifier defining the drawing context associated to the canvas. For WebGL 2.0 use `webgl2`.

#### options.settings
Type: `Object`<br/>
Default: `{}`<br/>

Overrides that can be used to alter the behaviour of the experience.

| Name                                     | Value      | Default         | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| devicePixelRatio                         | `number`   | `1`             | The resolution multiplier by which the scene is rendered relative to the canvas' resolution. Use `window.devicePixelRatio` for the highest possible quality, `1` for the best performance. |
| clearColor                               | `array`    | `[1,1,1,1]`     | The color in `rgba` that is used as the background of the scene. |
| clip                                     | `array`    | `[0.001, 100]`  | The near and far clip plane in 3D space. |
| position                                 | `number`   | `{x:0,y:0,z:2}` | The distance in 3D space between the center of the scene and the camera. |
| shouldRender                             | `boolean`  | `true`          | A boolean indicating whether the scene should start rendering automatically. |
| uniforms                                 | `object`   | `{}`            | Shared values between all instances that can be updated at any given moment. By default this feature is used to render all the instances with the same `uProjectionMatrix`, `uModelMatrix` and `uViewMatrix`. It's also useful for moving everything around with the same progress value; `uProgress`. |
| onSetup(gl)                              | `function` | `undefined`     | A setup hook that is called before first render which can be used for gl context changes. |
| onRender(renderer)                       | `function` | `undefined`     | A render hook that is invoked after every rendered frame. Use this to update `renderer.uniforms`. |

### .resize()

Update all values that are based on the dimensions of the canvas to make it look good on all screen sizes.

### .toggle(shouldRender)

Toggle the rendering state of the scene. When shouldRender is false `requestAnimationFrame` is disabled so no resources are used.

#### shouldRender
Type: `Boolean` <br/>
Default: `undefined` <br/>

An optional boolean to set the rendering state to a specific value. Leaving this value empty will result in a regular boolean switch.

### .add(key, settings)

This function is used to add instances to the renderer. These instances can be as *simple* or *complex* as you'd like them to be. There's no limit to how many of these you can add. Make sure they all have a different key!

#### key
Type: `String`<br/>
Default: `undefined`<br/>

Every instance should have a unique name. This name can also be used to destroy the instance specifically later.

#### settings
Type: `Object`<br/>
Default: `{}`<br/>

An object containing overrides for parameters that are used when getting the WebGL context from the canvas.

| Name        | Value      | Default      | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| attributes  | `array`    | `[]`         | Values used in the program that are stored once, directly on the GPU.       |
| uniforms    | `object`   | `{}`         | Values used in the program that can be updated on the fly.                  |
| vertex      | `string`   | -            | The vertex shader is used to position the geometry in 3D space.             |
| fragment    | `string`   | -            | The fragment shader is used to provide the geometry with color or texture.  |
| multiplier  | `number`   | `1`          | The amount of duplicates that will be created for the same instance.        |
| mode        | `number`   | `0`          | The way the instance will be rendered. Particles = 0, triangles = 4.        |
| geometry    | `object`   | `{}`         | Vertices (and optional normals) of a model.                                 |
| modifiers   | `object`   | `{}`         | Modifiers to alter the attributes data on initialize.                       |
| onRender    | `function` | `undefined`  | A render hook that is invoked after every rendered frame.                   |

> Note: Less instances with a higher multiplier will be faster than more instances with a lower multiplier!

### .remove(key)

Remove an instance from the scene (and from memory) by its key.

### .destroy()

Remove all instances and the renderer itself. The canvas element will remain in the DOM.

### .prepareAttribute(attribute)

Dynamically override an attribute with the same logic that is used during initial creation of the instance. The function requires an object with a name, size and data attribute.

> Note: The calculation of the data function is done on the CPU. Be sure to check for dropped frames with a lot of particles.

Attributes can also be switched. In the demo this is used to continue with a new start position identical to the end position. This can be achieved with `.prepareBuffer(attribute)` in which the data function is replaced with the final array.
