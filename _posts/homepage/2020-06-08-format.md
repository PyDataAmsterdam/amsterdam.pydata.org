Time differences throughout the world pose a challenge: preserving the
vibe of an in-person event while making sure nobody misses out!

The PyData Global approach is to **pre-record all talks and tutorials so that you
can watch them at your own pace**. Live events will complement pre-recorded
content, and will take place during **business hours of our four geographic focus
areas**. To learn more, click [here](pages/format).
