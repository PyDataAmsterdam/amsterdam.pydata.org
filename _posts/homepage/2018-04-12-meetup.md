Meetups bring together the Amsterdam PyData community for an evening of talks, workshops, lightning talks, brainstorms or challenge sessions. And more importantly -- free food and a chance to meet to your peers. 

Meetups happen on a monthly basis. Be sure to [subscribe](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-nl/?action=join) to our meetup page to be notified of any newly organized events.
