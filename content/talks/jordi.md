title = "LLM Agents 101: How I Gave ChatGPT Access to My To-Do List"
+++

ChatGPT is a fantastic assistant, but it cannot do everything yet. For example, it cannot automatically manage my calendar, update my to-do list, or do anything that requires it to perform actions. However, what would it take to make this reality? I decided to put it to the test by allowing ChatGPT to manage my to-do list for me.

During this presentation, I will first introduce you to the concepts of LLM-based agents and how they work. After this introduction, I will demo my agent-based to-do list manager. After this demo, we will dive into the implementation challenges, such as handling hallucinations, parsing actions, etc. I discovered some very clever engineering solutions and tricks to solve these problems, which I will share with you. By the end of the presentation, you will know how LLM-based agents work, how well they work, when they do not, and how to start implementing them yourself.

This talk is for people who want to learn how to build their first LLM-based agent. Familiarity with Python, PyDantic, and LMMs is nice during this presentation but not essential. As long as you love overengineered solutions to a basic to-do list, you will like this presentation.

## Speaker: Jordi Smit

Hi! My name is Jordi Smit. Iâ€™m deeply passionate about software engineering, data science, and automation. Nothing makes me happier than creating software that helps humans by automating a tedious and manual-intensive part of their job. Therefore, I love discussing data science since this field has opened the door to many new kinds of automation. However, data science solutions often stay stuck at the proof of concept level. To combat this issue, you also need software engineering knowledge. That is why I love the intersection between software engineering, data science, and automation.

I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at Xebia Data in Amsterdam. Here, I help companies to transform their ML-based models into production-ready applications. I love this job because it allows me to explore the intersection between software engineering and data science daily.
