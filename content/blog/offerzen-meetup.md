Join us on June 29th at 18:00 for another PyData Amsterdam Meetup to enjoy food, drinks, and excellent talks! We'll be hosted by OfferZen at their office at TNW City (Singel 542, 1017 AZ Amsterdam). Our first speaker is Sebastian Zeef, with practical security tips and information on what you as a developer can do to keep software secure. Our second speaker Luuk van der Velden will share his setup for MLOps and simplifying integration tests at the Dutch Railways.
