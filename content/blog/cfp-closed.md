We just closed our Call for Proposals! Following an extension period due to popular demand, we received an overwhelming response, with over 250 submissions pouring in from the global data science and Python community.

The abundance of high-quality proposals leaves us with the delightful challenge of curating the conference schedule. With such an impressive array of topics and speakers to choose from, PyData Amsterdam 2023 is shaping up to be an exceptional event for data enthusiasts. Over the next few weeks, we will carefully assess each submission for its relevance, innovation, and potential to inspire attendees. We are committed to creating a well-balanced and diverse program that reflects the latest advancements and trends in data science, machine learning, and Python.

Apart from reviewing ourselves, we would also like to hear from you! We invite everyone who has attended PyData Amsterdam in the past, or who has already purchased a ticket for this year's event to help us in the selection process. This is the best way to ensure the conference is exactly what you want it to be. Whether you have already secured your ticket or have been a part of previous PyData Amsterdam conferences, stay tuned for further updates and details on this initiative.
