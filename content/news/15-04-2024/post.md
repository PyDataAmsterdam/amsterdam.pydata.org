PyData Amsterdam 2023 is unfortunately over.  
\
We can look back to an extremely succesfull and fun event.  
\
 Over 800 people have visited the Kromhouthal over 3 days of conference, participating in our 8 workshops, attending our 5 amazing keynotes, listening to over 80 experienced speakers and visiting our 16 sponsors. This is obviously not the end of PyData Amsterdam, and we are already thinking about how to make next yearsâ€™ event even better.
