about = """We build software that helps people do what only they can do – give meaning. Data fills our modern world. It flows prolifically inside organizations, customer interactions, product usage, research, imaging, and beyond. What if we could use data to predict the future? In most cases, we can make predictions through ML & AI, but to do so in a meaningful and impactful way, data needs to be accurate, comprehensive, and without bias.

To make the best predictions, we believe teams with domain expertise should be responsible for annotating and curating data. It's called data labeling, and it’s a process of real people giving meaning to the information they see on the screen. HumanSignal was founded to take data labeling
