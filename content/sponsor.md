# Why Sponsor

Join our community at PyData Amsterdam, from 14-16 September 2023. Engage, network, and collaborate with peers and like-minded people in the Python Data community. Sponsoring this event allows you to meet with data professionals ranging from startup CTOs to corporate developers to senior technology executives from all over the world. Take this chance to inform this community about your organization's products, services or job offerings.

Sponsoring PyData Amsterdam allows you to associate your brand with a fast-growing but mature technology community. You will take advantage of participating in a professionally-organized conference run by a neutral nonprofit where content is curated by the community.

You also give back to the open source community. NumFocus reinvests profits from our events to directly support NumFocus’s sponsored projects such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and many more.

# Sponsor benefits FAQ

## What is included with an Expo Booth?
An expo booth is a 3x3 area with table and chairs, plus wi-fi and electricity.
Sponsor booths are integrated into common areas where they will attract attendee traffic. Sponsors
are responsible for shipping charges to and from the conference. 

Monitors and other technical equipment are not a standard part of an expo booth, but can be supplied by us.

### What is Premium Logo Placement?
Diamond and Platinum sponsor logos receive preferential treatment on all logo-related benefits (top
line, centered, or first; larger than others). Includes the opportunity to place your company logo on
attendee badges and/or lanyards.

### What is Top Billing?
Diamond sponsors are always listed first, before any other sponsor. Diamond sponsors are acknowledged in the
title of the event as Special Thanks To Our Diamond Sponsors with your logo.


### Do Sponsor Talks and Tutorials Go Through the Regular Review Process?
Host and Platinum sponsors are able to present a talk or tutorial at the event. While sponsor talks and
tutorials do not go through the regular review process, presentation proposals must be submitted for
approval by the review committee. The committee will help ensure that your presentation’s content is
appropriate and relevant to the audience at the event.

###  What is included in access to the Attendee List?
The list will be a .csv file with attendee name, email, job title, and company from those who have opted
in during registration.

### What are the Attendee Submitted LinkedIn/Resume/Website Links?
During registration, attendees are invited to provide a url that links to their personal website, resume,
or LinkedIn profile to be shared with event sponsors. All PyData sponsors have access to the
submitted links.


### What is the Job Board?
Your company’s job listings will be published on the event website and emailed out to all event
attendees. Limit 5 job listings per sponsor.
