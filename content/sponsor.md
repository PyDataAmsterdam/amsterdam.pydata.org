# Why Sponsor

Join our community at PyData Amsterdam, from 18-20 September 2024. Engage, network, and collaborate with peers and like-minded people in the Python Data community. Sponsoring this event allows you to meet with data professionals ranging from startup CTOs to corporate developers to senior technology executives from all over the world. Take this chance to inform this community about your organization's products, services or job offerings.

Sponsoring PyData Amsterdam allows you to associate your brand with a fast-growing but mature technology community. You will take advantage of participating in a professionally-organized conference run by a neutral nonprofit where content is curated by the community.

You also give back to the open source community. NumFocus reinvests profits from our events to directly support NumFocus’s sponsored projects such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and many more.

# Sponsor benefits FAQ


![sponsor-benefits](/img/sponsor-benefits.png)
## What is included with an Expo Booth?
For the sponsor booths at our conference we are working with a partner [PLAAT](https://www.plaatreklame.nl).

An expo booth is a 3x3 area (or 6x3 for diamond sponsors) with table and chairs, plus wi-fi and electricity.
Please review the [sponsorship prospectus](/PyData-Amsterdam-2024-Sponsorship-Prospectus.pdf) for more details and
customization options.

Sponsor booths are integrated into common areas where they will attract attendee traffic. Sponsors
are responsible for shipping charges to and from the conference. 

Monitors and other technical equipment are not a standard part of an expo booth, but can be supplied by us.


### What are sponsored talks?
If you have a sponsored talk included with your benefits, please make sure the talk and speaker description are uploaded correctly in our CfP system.
While sponsor talks and tutorials do not go through the regular review process, presentation proposals must be submitted for
approval by the review committee. The committee will help ensure that your presentation’s content is
appropriate and relevant to the audience at the event.

Please also indicate the availability of the speaker for the conference days. Given that scheduling is a difficult task for us we would appreciate some flexibility here.

Talk requirements:
- 25 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A
- Please avoid pure commercial pitches as they will be less appreciated by the audience
- Feel free to reach out to us for any feedback on your talk proposal

###  What is included in access to the Attendee List?
The list will be a .csv file with attendee name, email, job title, and company from those who have opted
in during registration.

### What are the Attendee Submitted LinkedIn/Resume/Website Links?
During registration, attendees are invited to provide a url that links to their personal website, resume,
or LinkedIn profile to be shared with event sponsors. All PyData sponsors have access to the
submitted links.

### What is the Job Board?
Your company’s job listings will be published on the event website and emailed out to all event
attendees. Limit 5 job listings per sponsor.
