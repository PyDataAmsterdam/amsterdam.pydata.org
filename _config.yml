  title: About PyData
  text:
    PyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
    PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to
    share ideas and learn from each other. All proceeds of PyData Global go to support NumFOCUS' mission.<br /><br />

    The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches,
    and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.
    PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.<br /><br />

    The PyData Code of Conduct governs this conference. To discuss any issues or concerns relating to the code of
    conduct or the behavior of anyone at a PyData conference (or meetup), please contact NumFOCUS Executive Director
