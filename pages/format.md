## Our Format

2020 has brought constant unexpected change to a lot of our lives: social
distancing, closed schools, travel restrictions and curfews to name a few.
During these times of uncertainty, we think it is more important than ever to
ensure everyone in our community can learn at their own pace, at the times they
find most convenient.

**As a result, the following content will be pre-recorded and released
throughout the event to attendees. As the conference happens, you will have
access to more and more of this content, ready to watch whenever you are:**

* Keynote talks (30-60 minutes)
* Regular talks (30 minutes) and short talks (15 minutes)
* Tutorials (90 minutes)

Pre-recorded talks do not mean, however, that PyData will lose its
in-the-moment vibe. **We are partnering with [Gather](https://gather.town) to
create a virtual conference space in full 2D glory!** From this virtual world,
you will be able to strike up video chats with other participants, meet our
speakers, and attend all of our live events:

* Fireside chats with keynote speakers
* Q&A panels with speakers
* Pop quizzes
* A poster session
* Watch parties with video and text-based chat
* Sprints
* ... and more!

**These events will take place live in friendly (9am to 5pm) schedules for our
geographical focus areas.**

## Geographical Focus Areas
Based on the current reach of our community throughout the world, PyData Global
will primarily target four geographic areas. If youâ€™re in one of these areas,
rest assured that you will be able to participate in live events like watch
parties, panels, quizzes and more!

* American West
* American East
* Africa, Europe and the Middle East
* South Asia

These areas are well spread out throughout the globe. If the sun rises for you
after sunrise in Delhi and your sunset is before the one in San Francisco, you
will be able to join live events during business (9am to 5pm) hours.

## *Written* English

Attendees will be able to meaningfully interact with every single session
through written English. Whether you want to ask a question to a speaker during
a panel or join a sprint, there will always be a way for you to express
yourself through written English.
