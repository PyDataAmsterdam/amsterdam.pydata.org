At **Two Sigma**, we use Open Source Software, and we’re passionate about giving back to the programming community. We want to make sure that the OSS projects that we and so many others rely on will still be functional far into the future. Supporting OSS can take many forms: making substantial contributions to projects we use regularly, open sourcing tools we’ve developed in house, and financially sponsoring non-profits that contribute to a healthy open source ecosystem. That’s why we are a Corporate Partner of NumFOCUS. Two Sigma is proud to support NumFOCUS sponsored projects pandas and Jupyter.
