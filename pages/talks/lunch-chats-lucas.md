During the last five years, Machine Learning became a standard tool for Product Development in Booking.com. 
Today, it plays a role in every step of the customer journey. Hundreds of Data Scientists build, 
deploy and experiment with hundreds of machine-learned models exposing them to millions of users every day.

Supporting Machine Learning at scale involves many challenges, not least of which is shipping the models to 
production reliably, as fast as possible and accommodating a large variety of model types, 
invocation settings, libraries, data sources, monitoring approaches, etc. We'll interview Lucas Bernardi, Principal 
Data Scientist at Booking.com to see how they overcame these challenges
