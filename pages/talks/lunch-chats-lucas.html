<p>During the last five years, Machine Learning became a standard tool for Product Development in Booking.com. 
Today, it plays a role in every step of the customer journey. Hundreds of Data Scientists build, 
deploy and experiment with hundreds of machine-learned models exposing them to millions of users every day.</p>

<p>Supporting Machine Learning at scale involves many challenges, not least of which is shipping the models to 
production reliably, as fast as possible and accommodating a large variety of model types, 
invocation settings, libraries, data sources, monitoring approaches, etc. Weâ€™ll interview Lucas Bernardi, Principal 
Data Scientist at Booking.com to see how they overcame these challenges</p>
