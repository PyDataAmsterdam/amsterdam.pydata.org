<p>Forests are essential to our future. More than 1.6 billion people depend on forests for food, water, fuel and medicines.
They support 80% of non-human life on land and safeguard the climate by sequestering carbon. But forest fires, pests,
diseases and especially deforestation lay waste to tens of millions of hectares a year. And under pressure of climate 
change this is only increasing.</p>

<p>At 20tree.ai we apply machine learning to high resolution satellite imagery, looking at trees and other vegetation all 
over the world constantly! In this talk I will dive into some of the work we do around monitoring both urban and rural 
green space. Secondly I will talk about how we bridge experimental R&amp;D with applied ML work using nbdev, a framework 
made popular through the use of the second version of the popular fastai ML framework. And finally I will go over some
 of our continued challenges of dealing with large volumes of extremely noisy data, and reconciling this with the need 
to being cost-effective as a scrappy startup</p>

<p>Roelof Pieters is CTO and co-founder of 20tree.ai, double Computer Science dropout (once as Bsc and more recently his Phd), 
has double degrees in Social/Development Anthropology and has the double distinction of running two earlier failed startups, 
most recently creative.ai. Roelof also heads up Sunshine Lab, a sustainable design studio, and only codes in python (of course)</p>
