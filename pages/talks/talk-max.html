<p>Privacy, data governance, and ethics have all become essential topics in a modern data-driven company. But what even are they? And how do you get started with them?</p>

<p>We regularly get asked what data governance is. By definition, it’s a combination of three things: formalizing behaviors, holding people accountable, and supporting ethics at scale. But what does that really mean and how do you put it into practice? We like to think of it as the standardization of work, both the setting of standards and testing for them to ensure that they are applied, while simultaneously getting people to want to do the right thing. In a number of ways, governance is a giant design problem. How can we make the right thing easy?</p>

<p>In this talk I’ll go into more detail of how we’ve put this into practice at The Times, including challenges we faced along the way and key lessons learned. For example, how we worked together with our marketing and advertising teams to create rulebooks for safe, secure, and ethical data processing. I’ll also focus specifically on how data analytics supports our mission.</p>

<p>My hope is that this talk will provide more clarity on an area of work that very much tends to feel fuzzy and seemingly-overwhelming, and in turn encourage other companies to consider a data governance program of their own.</p>
