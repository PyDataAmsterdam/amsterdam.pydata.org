title: Madelon Hulsebos - Keep the data flowing
description: 
---

Data scientist and engineers waste too much time on data issues and do not get to focus on developing and productionizing models. Potential causes range from mistyped customer IDs in Excel to incomplete and duplicate data entries. What follows is an inefficient back-and-forth process where we explore the data, summarize data issues, and send it back to the data owner through multiple iterations. This process drains time, energy, drives costs, and increases the chances of projects failing completely.

All ML pipelines make assumptions on the structure of the data being used. Once those assumptions are violated, pipelines break or models produce incorrect output. In this workshop, you will learn how to deploy Great Expectations for automating data validation, facilitating hand-offs from data owner to data scientist/engineer, and how to integrate Great Expectations into ML pipelines.

The workshop consists of an introduction to the package, live demonstration, and hands-on session. During the hands-on session, you will solve a data puzzle for which they will receive a messy data file and a set of data expectations. When you solve the puzzle using Great Expectations, you will be rewarded with a good functioning pipeline.
