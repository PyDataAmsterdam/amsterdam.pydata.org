<p>Open source developers create tools that are used by millions, often in ways that their creators never imagined. Open data programs share data for the same purpose, enabling others to discover insights and build applications to help understand and improve their communities. And yet while open source and open data have both grown rapidly over the past decades, successful data science projects combining the two are surprisingly hard to find.</p>

<p>This presentation, from the City of Boston’s former Chief Data Officer, will dig into the question of why data science projects built on open data so often fall short of their potential, and give lessons for how to design projects that succeed. Participants will learn how open data programs work, see examples of innovative projects using open data, and hear about the unique challenges facing projects that seek to promote positive social change. We’ll also discuss how technologists can better collaborate with the public sector, to match their work to the needs of governments and nonprofits and ensure that their efforts are put into practice.</p>
