<p>“Beautiful is better than ugly”, “Simple is better than complex” and “There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.” are a few statements from the Zen of Python. They explain the ideology behind the language: a simple, readable but yet powerful programming language. Over the years this has made it into one of the most popular languages in the world, especially within the field of AI.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will go into the internals of the language and see how source code is executed. Execution in (C)Python is a multi-stage process where source code is first parsed and compiled into an intermediate representation known as Python Byte Code (those .pyc files) before being fed into the interpreter. All of this happens behind the scenes every time you run a program. The presentation will explain each stage from a conceptual level and using practical examples.</p>

<p>At the end of the talk, the audience will have a better understanding of the internals of Python. They will be able to reason about optimizations within the language, but foremost be able to answer “How does it work?”.</p>
