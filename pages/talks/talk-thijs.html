<p>At Hack The Planet we are using our technical skills for the better. We have been working on many different challenges using various technologies like virtual reality to combat loneliness and autonomous flying drones to monitor forest fires. For our latest project we have developed a sensor that can detect mobile phones of poachers.</p>

<p>The system gathers data from the sensors. With analyses we can monitor and triangulate locations of suspicious activities. The data is really valuable for rangers on the ground and we are looking for ways to get more insights out of it. Think about detecting patterns and predicting poaching activity.</p>

<p>I will share what we have so far and Iâ€™d love to hear your ideas on getting the most out of this system to help rangers on the ground to protect elephants and rhinos that are facing extinction.</p>
