During the workshop we cover the building blocks of Siamese Mask R-CNN model and showcase its ability to 
detect and segment objects from novel categories based on a single reference image. 
Next,we try a single deployment. Lastly, we discuss possible limitations and improvements. 
At the end of the workshop, participants will have a basic understanding on how to prototype and 
deploy human-like visual search applications.
