title: Open-source sprints
description: 
---

This year's PyData conference includes an open-source sprint! During the sprint, you can contribute to an open-source project you regularly use. A maintainer will be present to guide the sprint and explain the internals of the project; a perfect way of deep diving into a project. We aim to have a contribution merged into the project!

The open source sprint is hosted by our sponsor Xomnia. It will be held at
their office at Raamstraat 7-1, Amsterdam.

Plotnine is an implementation of <b>a grammar of graphics</b> in Python, it is based on ggplot2. The grammar allows users to compose plots by explicitly mapping data to the visual objects that make up the plot.
<br> <br>
Plotting with a grammar is powerful, it makes custom (and otherwise complex) plots are easy to think about and then create, while the simple plots remain simple. </p>"
