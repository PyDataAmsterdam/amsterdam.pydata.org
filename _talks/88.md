# Better Code for Data Science

The coding quality must be improved in Data Science and AI. 
Though code in notebooks may provide some working solutions, too often it's hard to maintain, reuse or even to read for an outsider - apart from being inefficient.
In this talk I will share a decade of Python experience and provide background, good practices and guidelines that enable everyone to write proper code for Data & AI.
