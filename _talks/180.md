In 2016 I wrote a blog post called Fizz Buzz in Tensorflow, which went modestly viral. In the years since I have invented and/or collected other stupid and/or clever ways of solving Fizz Buzz, the ten most interesting of which I expounded on in "Ten Essays on Fizz Buzz." In this talk I'll quickly take you through these ten Python solutions, most of which are delightfully surprising.

## Speaker

### Joel Grus

Joel Grus is Principal Engineer at Capital Group, where he leads a small team focused on the design and development of machine learning and data products. He's the author of the quirky "Ten Essays on Fizz Buzz", the beloved "Data Science from Scratch", and the polarizing JupyterCon presentation "I Don't Like Notebooks."
