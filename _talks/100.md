The Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm is often used for online, large-scale machine learning problems but suffers from randomness in prediction. Weijie J. Su and Yuancheng Zhu provide a solution with their novel HiGrad algorithm that applies statistical inference to SGD predictions. This talk will explain the mechanics of HiGrad and demonstrate its implementation in Python.
