Creating a Jupyter notebook with a coherent story and code blocks is the initial fun part but distributing it, making sure everything works as intended and is reproducible across all systems isn't always that fun. In this talk we will introduce a tool nbreproduce, which provides a wrapper around Docker Jupyter stacks to execute notebooks locally inside a docker container.
