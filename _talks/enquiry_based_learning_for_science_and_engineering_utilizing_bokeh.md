# Enquiry-Based Learning for Science and Engineering utilizing Bokeh

Computational modules are valuable pedagogical tools to teach complex engineering concepts via enquiry-based learning (EBL). In this context, we have developed interactive online visualization-based python modules to explain science and engineering concepts (at a senior undergraduate and graduate level) through common chemical engineering applications.

## Speakers

### Raghuram Thiagarajan

Experienced from data collection to predictive model development, and validating all parts of the process till model production stage. Utilize visualization for validation, communication and analysis of all parts of the pipeline.

Developed numerical models and experiments to study various systems tackling vehicle handling simulations, polymeric systems and biological systems. Involved in tire engineering for racing teams which won championships nationally and contributed to significant improvement in testing procedure for an OEM.  Designed, developed and implemented hardware and software side of a shoe box size scanner. Significantly reduced decision making time with the use of interactive visualization for engineers. Founding member of miLEAD a business consulting group for high tech start ups. Passionate about research, data visualization/analytics and best practices.

### Anna Moragne

I am currently a Senior at Lehigh University studying Statistics and Computer Science. I joined the STEM Learning Through Visualization Project in the Summer for 2020 and have been continuing to work on the project into the fall. I have really enjoyed being able to use and gain more coding skills through working on this project so far and am looking forward to being able to carry these skills over into future career work.
