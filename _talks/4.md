Streamlit is a fantastic new tool that lets you create powerful and highly-interactive web apps for your machine learning projects with deceptively simple Python scripts.
The best thing about Streamlit is that it doesn’t require any knowledge of web development. If you know Python, you’re good to go!

## Speaker

### Steven Kolawole

Steven is a Computer Science Undergrad in his penultimate year, with skillset in the intersection between Data Science and Software Engineering...So he is, most times, a Machine Learning Engineer. 

Steven is big on community development, passionate about helping tech muggles find their feet, and on a path to become a Developer Advocate. He is a regular meetups' facilitator and has given talks at several high profile events like PyCon Africa and PyData Global. He is currently the Acting AI City Lead for DSN AI+ Abeokuta, deputy Campus Lead of AI+ FUNAAB, a core team member of DSC-FUNAAB, and NaijaHacks Campus Ambassador for FUNAAB. 

Steven has been trying to gain new hobbies (outside tech) recently. For instance, watching dance tutorials on YouTube, but he has failed miserably so far.
