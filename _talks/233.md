# Building fairer models for finance

Fairness and bias are rightly hot topics in ML because of their impact on people’s lives. It’s particularly important in finance, where bad decisions can limit the ability to participate in society. We look at how fairness can be defined, and how the law defines it. We explore how to detect bias, the trade off between bias and performance, and how to build fairer models that still perform well.
