# Open Source Fairness

Fairness is a hot topic in AI/machine learning/technology these days, but there isn't much clear guidance on how to operationalize it into actual code. This talk will walk the audience through a few basic fairness algorithms and their open source implementations. We will also review recent developments in both the engineering and law of machine learning fairness.
