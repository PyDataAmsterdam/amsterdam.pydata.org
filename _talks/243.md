# Matrix Profile API: A novel cross language time-series mining library

The explosive growth of the data science community provides a hurdle for traditional time-series analysis methods, as many practitioners lack experience in advanced mathematical and statistical principles. To make time-series data mining more approachable, we have developed a novel Matrix Profile-based suite of libraries for novices and advanced practitioners.
