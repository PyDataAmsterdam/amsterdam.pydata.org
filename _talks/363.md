Exploratory data analysis is a practical approach to working with real data, and Pandas and Matplotlib are excellent tools for reading, validating, and visualizing data.  In this tutorial, we use data from the General Social Survey (GSS) to learn about these tools by exploring changes in political affiliation and attitudes in the United States over the last 50 years.
