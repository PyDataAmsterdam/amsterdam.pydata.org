This talk presents lessons learned from an initial, novel application of quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms to optimize core loading patterns. Some of the challenges faced have included performance concerns on large simulation problems, lack of quality open-source code for some target algorithms, and the need for software interactions with a proprietary software.
