# Visions: An Open-Source Library for Semantic Data

Many common data workflows rely on semantically meaningful representations of data types. Lacking these, type inference algorithms (e.g. those used by pandas & the tidyverse) employ fragile, rule-based heuristics which complicate programming logic and expressiveness. This talk will explore ways to leverage the power of expressive semantic data types using the visions library.
