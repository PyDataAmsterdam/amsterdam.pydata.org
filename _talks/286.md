# Autonomous Vehicles See More With Thermal Imaging: Multi-modal thin cross section Object Detection

In the era of AI there's a renewed focus on making autonomous cars a reality. However there are many fallbacks like spurious identification of pedestrian as a piece of paper, ramming into bicycles due to missed identification. But the problem can be solved using thermal Images instead of RGB.  This talk revolves around how I leveraged thermal images to enhance the vision of autonomous cars!
