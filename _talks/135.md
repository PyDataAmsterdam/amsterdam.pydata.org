Pandas provides convenience methods to read and write to databases using to_sql and read_sql. They provide great usability and a uniform interface for all databases that support an SQL Alchemy connection. Sadly, the layer of convenience also introduces a performance loss. Luckily, for a lot of databases, a performant access layer is available.
