The UBI Center is a think tank researching universal basic income (UBI) policies using open source technologies. We start with open data, simulate UBI policy reforms with open source economic modeling software, and share the results on our open source website with tools like Jupyter-Book. This talk shares how three of our projects contribute to both open science and public policy understanding.
