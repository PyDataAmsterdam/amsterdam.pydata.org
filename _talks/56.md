# VolEsti : a sampling and volume approximation library

The simplest way to get, install and try volesti is to use the CRAN package https://cran.r-project.org/package=volesti  e.g. from RStudio.
Alternatively, one can follow the instructions in the README of VolEsti github https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation 
There are links to setup the C++, R or python interfaces, tutorials, wiki-pages and a first time contribution tutorial.

## Speakers

### Vissarion Fisikopoulos

The speaker has a decade of experience in research and development of algorithms in both academia and industry. His interests lie at the intersection of geometric computing, optimization, statistical computing, mathematical software and algorithm engineering. He holds a PhD in computer science, more than 20 scientific publications in top rank journals and conferences, more than 40 talks in international conferences, seminars with invitation and technological events.

### Apostolos Chalkis

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Department of Telecommunications and Informatics in National Kapodistrian University of Athens. 

My scientific and research interests are:  

1. Markov chains for sampling from high dimensional multivariate distributions.  
2. Volume estimation of convex and non-convex bodies in high dimensions.  
3. Crises detection and portfolio performance evaluation in big stock markets.  
4. Randomized methods for convex optimization.  
5. Optimized implementation of state-of-the-art geometric algorithms.
