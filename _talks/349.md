# COVID-19 Visualizations, the Good, the Bad and the Malicious

COVID-19, the pandemic that kills 30K+ globally by May 18th, is also the hot topic in data analytics/science. Media, research institutes and data scientists created many visualization projects. Some projects are informative and creative, some are flawed. Quite a few are designed to mislead people without analytical skills. This talk serves as a critical review of such projects.
