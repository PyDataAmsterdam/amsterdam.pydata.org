# Accelerating Text Processing With RAPIDS

See how you can speed up text processing on GPUs without ever leaving Python.  In this session, we will explore the use of  DataFrame APIs, up through higher level, special text manipulation functions, and on up into sklearn style Text Vectorizers and integration with SpaCy, HuggingFace, to get 100x+ faster NLP pipelines. We also cover scaling up these workflows to multiple nodes using Dask.
