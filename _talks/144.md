# Sampling from (truncated) high-dimensional logconcave densities with VolEsti (GeomScale Project)

This talk focuses on sampling from (truncated) high-dimensional log-concave densities. We present the most recent contributions to VolEsti which include algorithms for log-concave sampling via efficiently solving ODEs, in the R language.
