# Bayesian Decision Science: A framework for making data informed decisions under uncertainty

Decisions are everywhere, from deciding what to wear given a weather forecast each day to deciding how much inventory to hold in a multi million dollar supply chain. What is certain is that tools in the PyData ecosystem can help you, or your business, make those decisions with more confidence. Its called decision science in this talk we'll cover what it is and how to use it.
