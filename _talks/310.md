# What's new in pandas?

Pandas finally reached a 1.0 release in early 2020. But, there is still a lot of development activity going on. This talk will give an overview of whatâ€™s happening in the latest releases of pandas and where we are heading to, and highlight some important milestones for the project achieved over the last year.
