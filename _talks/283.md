# Climate Change: analyzing remote sensing data with Python

At The National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado we distribute a trove of remote sensing data that is used globally to conduct important scientific research. We'll explore in an interactive way some of these data sets scientists use to assess and forecast climate change.

## Speaker

### Luis Lopez

I'm a Software Engineer at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. NSIDC is one of 9 data centers for NASA's Earth Data systems. I'm currently working on building services on top of remote sensing data and trying to close the gap between cryospheric research and understandable, reproducible science.

I'm from Mexico and attended grad school at the University of Colorado.
