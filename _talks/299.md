# Panel: Dashboards for PyData

In this tutorial, you will see how to use Panel (https://panel.pyviz.org) to add widgets and layouts to the output from just about any plotting program, and then how to share the result as a fully standalone application. You should walk away knowing you can very easily make any of your analyses interactive and shareable, in just a few lines of code!
