# napari

Under our developer resources https://napari.org/docs/developers/index.html the napari project has resources like a contributing guidelines and a code of conduct. On our repository we use `good first issue` and `sprints` labels. We will also put together a dedicated introduction to this sprint, like we did for our successful SciPy 2020 remote sprint https://hackmd.io/V_6UBEdETXiztdg_K8IwbA?edit.
