# Parallel processing in Python: The current landscape

Python has a vast ecosystem of tools for scientific computing and data science. However, when data size or computational complexity grows, users may encounter performance challenges. This talk will cover the current landscape of parallel processing tools in Python, with a focus on which tools are best suited for various workloads such as arrays, dataframes, machine learning, and deep learning.
