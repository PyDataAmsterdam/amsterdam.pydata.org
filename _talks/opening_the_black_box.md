# Opening the Black Box

Data scientists have likely heard that machine learning models are ‘black boxes’ and not interpretable. This notion, once formerly true, is no longer correct. In this talk, the modelers at Southeast Toyota Finance will focus on model-agnostic interpretability techniques. We’ll provide an end-to-end example of the experimentation process of modeling combined with interpretability techniques.

## Speakers
