title: "Basic Pitfalls in Waveform Analysis"
kind: "Talk"
speakers: "Yukio Okuda"
---

This talk focuses on the usual preparation steps of waveform analysis, digitizing, and converting to spectra. A simple python module DEEPS shows the errors of waves having frequencies lower than Nyquist frequencies, which is verified on an open dedicated dataset and YouTube sounds. The verification may improve domain-specific feature extractions of your analyses.
