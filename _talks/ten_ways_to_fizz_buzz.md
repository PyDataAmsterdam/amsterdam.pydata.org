# Ten Ways to Fizz Buzz

In 2016 I wrote a blog post called Fizz Buzz in Tensorflow, which went modestly viral. In the years since I have invented and/or collected other stupid and/or clever ways of solving Fizz Buzz, the ten most interesting of which I expounded on in "Ten Essays on Fizz Buzz." In this talk I'll quickly take you through these ten Python solutions, most of which are delightfully surprising.
