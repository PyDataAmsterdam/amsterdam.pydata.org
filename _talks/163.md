# Skinny Pandas Riding on a Rocket

With larger datasets we need to be smarter about how we use Pandas to get results. We'll look at strategies to shrink our data to get more into RAM, offload computation to tools like Dask or Vaex, store with Parquet or SQLite, make calculations faster and retain debuggability.
