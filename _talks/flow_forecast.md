## Speakers

### Isaac Godfried

I'm a deep learning practitioner focused on applying A.I. to real world problems in health, climate, and agriculture. Most of my research focuses on time series forecasting, transfer learning, and multi-modal learning (though I occasionally dip into NLP). As most of my solutions need to preform in real world scenarios a lot of my time also goes to making high quality DL frameworks that integrate with cloud services, employ good coding practices, make it easy to ship and track model performance in production. I'm currently leading a team of researchers at [CoronaWhy to forecast COVID-19](https://github.com/CoronaWhy/task-ts/wiki) spread and am developing an [easy to use deep learning for time series framework](https://github.com/AIStream-Peelout/flow-forecast).
