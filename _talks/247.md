# Modin

We have detailed documentation for setting up development environments and contributing code: https://modin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/contributing.html

When a pull request is created, a checklist is also there to ensure it is well formed.

For those rusty or less familiar with Git, we will also do a quick walk-through for forking, cloning, and pushing branches.
