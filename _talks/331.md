Dask is a widely used parallel computing solution for PyData.  As Dask is deployed more into production we see challenges around costs, auth, security, and others.  This talk discusses challenges and opportunities around deploying Dask in production, and a specific service, Coiled, designed to both ease institutional adoption of scalable PyData and increase accessibility to the general public.
