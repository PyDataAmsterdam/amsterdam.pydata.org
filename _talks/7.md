Traditional time series analysis techniques have found success in a variety of data mining tasks. However, they often require years of experience to master and the recent development of straightforward, easy-to-use analysis tools has been lacking. STUMPY is a scientific Python library for modern time series analysis that leverages popular open source software and enables you to do better science!
