Continuous integration is a key practice from DevOps that encourages frequent code check-ins and testing in a production-like environment. While continuous integration is typically associated with speeding up development cycles for software, it also provides a rigorous framework for automating analysis, modeling, and reporting data viz and statistical results that is desirable for open science.
