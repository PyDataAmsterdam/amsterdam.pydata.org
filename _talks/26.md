In this talk I present the fundamental design concepts behind DataFrames.jl to help potential users get started with using it. I show how an exemplary pandas data processing pipeline can be transferred to DataFrames.jl. Finally I discuss how DataFrames.jl integrates with the whole data science ecosystem available in the Julia language.
