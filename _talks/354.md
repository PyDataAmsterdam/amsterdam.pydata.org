The Pyodide project compiles the scientific Python stack to WebAssembly, so that it can be run in the browser. It supports data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, parts of scipy and scikit-learn. In this talk I will outline the current capabilities and existing challenges. I will then illustrate how to use pyodide to run ML models in the browser and compare it with other existing approaches.
