# Quickly deploying explainable AI dashboards

Explainable AI means more than just calculating SHAP values from your model, it means making the workings of your machine learning model transparant and investigable for non-data scientist stakeholders, customers and regulators. The `explainerdashboard` package makes this easy to do from Jupyter in just a few lines of code.
