# Turn your notebook into a LaTeX-article with TexBook

Have you ever fancied writing your Lecture notes or tutorials into Jupyter notebooks that are beautifully typeset like a LaTeX-generated article? In this talk I will present TexBook, a pip-installable/pluggable/customisable Jupyter Notebook theme I developed in my spare time during the lockdown. The theme features a full-fledged CSS theme, and an extension for Google Colaboratory notebooks.

## Speakers

### Valerio Maggio

Valerio received his PhD in Computational Science by University of Naples, Federico II, with a thesis entitled “Improving Software Maintenance using Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques”, working on the definition of novel machine learning techniques to aid the maintainability of software projects. Since then, his research and professional interests are focused  on combining software engineering principles into the data science practice. Valerio is currently appointed as Senior Research Associate at the University of Bristol, where he works on methods and software tools for reproducible and interpretable machine/deep learning for bio medicine. He is also a member of the CRSE (Cloud Research Software Engineer) team as part of the Microsoft initiative for Higher Education and Research. Valerio is a very active member of the Python community, and lead member of the organising committee of many Python Conferences such as PyCon/PyData Italy and EuroScipy.
