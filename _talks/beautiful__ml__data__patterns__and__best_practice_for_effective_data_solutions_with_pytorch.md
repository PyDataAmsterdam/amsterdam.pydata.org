# Beautiful (ML) Data: Patterns & Best Practice for effective Data solutions with PyTorch

Data loading is essential to every Deep Learning model, and PyTorch has revolutionised the way in which data is managed in training & evaluation: Pythonic Dataset and DataLoader over list of numpy arrays. But there's more: batching-sampling-partitioning-augmentation. The tutorial explores the internals of torch.utils.data for patterns and best practices for efficient and PyTorchy data processing.

### Valerio Maggio

Valerio received his PhD in Computational Science by University of Naples Federico II,  working on the definition of novel machine learning techniques to aid the maintainability of software projects. Since then, his research and professional interests are focused on combining software engineering principles into the Data Science practice. Valerio is currently appointed as Senior Research Associate at the University of Bristol, where he works on methods and software tools for reproducible machine learning for healthcare. Valerio is also a member of the CRSE (Cloud Research Software Engineer) team as part of the Microsoft initiative for Higher Education and Research, and member of the organising committee of many Python Conferences like PyCon/PyData Italy and EuroScipy.
