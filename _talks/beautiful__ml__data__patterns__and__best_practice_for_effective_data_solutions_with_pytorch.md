# Beautiful (ML) Data: Patterns & Best Practice for effective Data solutions with PyTorch

Data loading is essential to every Deep Learning model, and PyTorch has revolutionised the way in which data is managed in training&evaluation: Pythonic Dataset and DataLoader over list of numpy arrays. But there's more: batching|sampling|partitioning|augmentation. The tutorial explores the internals of torch.utils.data for patterns and best practices for efficient and PyTorchy data processing.

### Valerio Maggio

Valerio received his PhD in Computational Science by University of Naples, Federico II, with a thesis entitled “Improving Software Maintenance using Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques”, working on the definition of novel machine learning techniques to aid the maintainability of software projects. Since then, his research and professional interests are focused  on combining software engineering principles into the data science practice. Valerio is currently appointed as Senior Research Associate at the University of Bristol, where he works on methods and software tools for reproducible and interpretable machine/deep learning for bio medicine. He is also a member of the CRSE (Cloud Research Software Engineer) team as part of the Microsoft initiative for Higher Education and Research. Valerio is a very active member of the Python community, and lead member of the organising committee of many Python Conferences such as PyCon/PyData Italy and EuroScipy.
