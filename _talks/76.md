Understanding in what situations an ML model fails is essential to attempt to fix the model’s flaws. For data scientists concerned with robust ML system design, this talk will show how to streamline error analysis thanks to Model Performance Predictors, by automatically breaking down model failures into meaningful clusters and comparing them with the successfully predicted baseline.
