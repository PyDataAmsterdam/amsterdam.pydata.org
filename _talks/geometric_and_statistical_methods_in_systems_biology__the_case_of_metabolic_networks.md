# Geometric and statistical methods in systems biology: the case of metabolic networks

Sampling the solution space of metabolic networks is a powerful, however computationally challenging, approach for interpreting the underlying mechanisms that govern the biological processes. *Volestipy* is a Python library that addresses this challenge by providing a variety of computational tools that scale to high dimensions.

### Haris Zafeiropoulos



### Apostolos Chalkis

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Department of Telecommunications and Informatics in National Kapodistrian University of Athens. 

My scientific and research interests are:  

1. Markov chains for sampling from high dimensional multivariate distributions.  
2. Volume estimation of convex and non-convex bodies in high dimensions.  
3. Crises detection and portfolio performance evaluation in big stock markets.  
4. Randomized methods for convex optimization.  
5. Optimized implementation of state-of-the-art geometric algorithms.
