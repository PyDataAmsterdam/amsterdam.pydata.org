# Bokeh

Bokeh currently has documentation for setting up the development environment (https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/dev_guide.html) and guidelines for contributing (https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/branch-2.2/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). We also plan on creating supplementary screencasts to better support attendees (https://discourse.bokeh.org/t/lessons-learned-during-mentored-sprints/5502).
