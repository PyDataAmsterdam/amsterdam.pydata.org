# Solving large-scale inverse problems in Python with PyLops

Inverse problems are at the core of many scientific disciplines. When working with large data and/or model vectors, an explicit matrix representation of the problem becomes unfeasible. In this tutorial we present PyLops, an open-source Python library that uses linear operators to solve matrix-free inverse problems. Examples of image deblurring and CT reconstruction will be presented as use cases.

## Speakers

### Matteo Ravasi

I am a geophysicist with a formal education in Telecommunication Engineering and strong background in Applied Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, and Computer Science. I enjoy tackling the entire life-cycle of complex scientific problems from developing new theoretical formulations and implementing numerical solutions, to creating user-friendly software libraries and front-end interfaces.

My expertise includes model- and data-driven inverse problems, statistical signal processing, wave propagation, uncertainty analysis, seismic imaging, quantitative interpretation, 4D seismic, multicomponent acquisition and processing, and numerical modelling. I am also a keen open-source contributor and I am currently involved in the development of several Python libraries such as PyLops and spgl1.
