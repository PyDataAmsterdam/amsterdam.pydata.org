# Taking Care of Parameters So You Don’t Have to with ParamTools

ParamTools is a general purpose library for input processing and validation. It was created for the “taxing” task of processing the inputs of Tax-Calculator, a model that uses one of the most complicated specifications of all: the US tax code. This talk will demonstrate how ParamTools provides a friendly API and how it helps wrangle inputs into data that can be used by your model.
