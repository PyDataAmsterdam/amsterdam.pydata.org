# Is a neural network better than Ash at detecting Team Rocket? If so, how?

In the world of Pokemon, there is a running gag in the inability of protagonist Ash Ketchum, at recognizing the series antagonist, Team Rocket. This fact got me thinking: is a neural network better than Ash? To answer this, I'm using TensorFlow, TensorFlow.js, and Google AutoML to visualize a network's activation maps to interpret why it says this is Team Rocket.
