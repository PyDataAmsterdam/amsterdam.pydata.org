Asyncio compatibility has been added recently to some fsspec-based file system implementations: http, s3 and gcs. Not only can you now call (some of) the API from async/await-style code, but bulk operations can be carried out massively concurrently, with potentially great speed-ups for file upload/download, copy and delete.
