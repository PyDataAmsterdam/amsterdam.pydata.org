In this talk, I will discuss the relationship between game theory, algorithm design, and machine learning, and how researchers have combined these fields, as part of the Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG), to develop new algorithms and mathematical frameworks for improving resource allocation and information access to promote social and economic equality within marginalized communities.

## Speaker

### Manojit Nandi

I am a senior data scientist whose work focuses on algorithmic fairness, model explainability, and Responsible AI. I am particularly interested in the "Data 4 Good" movement and the roles technology plays in driving social change.
