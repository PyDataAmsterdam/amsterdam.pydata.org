Have you ever fancied writing your Lecture notes or tutorials into Jupyter notebooks that are beautifully typeset like a LaTeX-generated article? In this talk I will present TexBook, a pip-installable/pluggable/customisable Jupyter Notebook theme I developed in my spare time during the lockdown. The theme features a full-fledged CSS theme, and an extension for Google Colaboratory notebooks.
