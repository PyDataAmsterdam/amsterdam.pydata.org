#### [See poster](../assets/images/posters/242.png)
This poster will first present the concepts of differential programming and how it can be used for modelling when available data is limited, but a priori knowledge is avaiable and high explainability is required.
It then review the state of the python ecosystem (with libraries lire JAX or taichi) and how it compares to Julia's SciML ecosystem.
