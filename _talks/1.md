# A crash-update to lifelines

lifelines, the popular Python survival analysis library, has come a long way since its release in 2013, and development has accelerated these past two years. In this crash-update, I will demonstrate some of the newest features of lifelines in the past two years, our philosophy of "make the current best practice easy", and what's to come in lifelines as we plan our first 1.x release.

## Speaker
