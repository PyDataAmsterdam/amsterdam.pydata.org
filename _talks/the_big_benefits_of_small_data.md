# The Big Benefits of Small Data

"The term "big data" is about machines and "small data" is about people." -Allen Bonde.   In this Small Data project, a team from the US Green Party's presidential campaign hand curates data in order to connect voters with politicians.     Much like the "Slow Food Movement", this talk lays out the principals of the "Small Data Movement".
