Word Embeddings have become popular in recent years. They come in all shapes and sizes and they are often part of a recommended approach for NLP problems. In this talk I would like to demonstrate what merits you might expect but also where they fall short. We may need to tackle some hype in under to understand what "lies" in word embddings.
