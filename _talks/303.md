In this talk, attendees will learn about natural language processing techniques (spaCy) using Python and how it can be combined with machine learning(scikit-learn) to generate new knowledge from the existing knowledge.  We will talk about how we designed curriculum using natural language processing, unsupervised machine learning and pointer-generator network.

## Speaker

### Gajendra Deshpande

I have delivered talks at SciPy India, PyCon FR, PyCon HK and JuliaCon. I use Python extensively for teaching and research. My major work includes using Python to develop prototypes in the field of Cyber Security. I lead PyData Belagavi and OWASP Belagavi chapters. I love to mentor students and volunteer at Free and Open Source events.
