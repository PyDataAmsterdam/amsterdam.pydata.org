Members of the United States Green Party, working for the Howie Hawkins presidential campaign, and numerous state parties, are crowdsourcing a map of the  United States Green Party politicians, organizations and events.  It is not just a map, it is an object model of the organization, running on a hierarchical object-graph database.
