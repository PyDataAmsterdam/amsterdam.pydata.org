As the impact of data science & engineering increasingly reaches farther and wider, our professional responsibility as practitioners becomes more critical to society. In this talk we will cover practical steps that engineers and data scientists can take to ensure best practice, and reduce the probability of undesired outcomes when designing, building and deploying data-driven systems.
