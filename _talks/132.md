# Hypothesis

I create a "meta-issue" for each sprint, eg. https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/issues/2510

This includes links to user+dev docs, a tutorial, the event page, and a selection of tractable issues organised by difficulty (though beginner issues are rare these days).

I'll also help sprints on projects *using* hypothesis, including Numpy, Pandas, Astropy, scikit-learn, ...
