# Scalable cross-filtering dashboards with Panel, HoloViews and hvPlot

Introducing automatic linked selection and cross filtering tools for HoloViews, GeoViews, and hvPlot supporting the concise and convenient .plot() interface in Pandas or Xarray along with custom widgets from Panel, allowing data scientists to create even complex dashboards relating values across each of the dimensions without having to program with callbacks or other advanced mechanisms.
