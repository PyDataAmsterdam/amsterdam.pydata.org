Transitioning analysis from familiar Python data manipulation tools to unfamiliar JavaScript visualization tools - for visualization that's interactive, effective & aesthetic - can be a barrier for many data scientists. This talk will inspire you to use Altair to make professional looking statistical charts (like The NYT & The Economist etc) rapidly, for effective visualization in Python.
