# Building one (multi-task) model to rule them all!

This is the story of how we built the Octopod library. Octopod streamlines the training of multi-task PyTorch networks. It supports training with multiple task-specific datasets, multiple inputs, and ensembles of multi-task networks. We will discuss technical details of the library as well as interpersonal challenges we faced along the way.
