Deep neural networks are the modern day Swiss-knife for image processing. I will review visualization methods for evaluating, debugging and interpreting the performance and decisions of deep networks. I will present some real-world usages that I applied in the medical domain. We will play hands-on with heatmap techniques using online notebooks, which you can later apply to your own data and models
