                <h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>PyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS and thus abides by the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>We value the participation of each member of the PyData community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially sponsored by PyData or not.</p>

<p>To make clear what is expected, all delegates, speakers, exhibitors and volunteers at any PyData event are required to conform to the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct, since PyData is a NumFOCUS program. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>

<p>We reproduce here certain portions of the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct that are specifically relevant to in-person events. We encourage all PyData participants to review the complete <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-shorter-version">The Shorter Version</h2>
<p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes and language are not appropriate for PyData.</p>

<p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.</p>

<p>PyData is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

<p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-report">How to Report</h2>
<p>If you wish to make a report at a PyData event, please find a member of the event staff and ask to speak with the PyData Committee Chair(s). Another PyData committee member will take your report if you don’t wish to speak with the chair(s) or if they are for any reason unavailable.</p>

<p>Typically, staff at PyData events are wearing shirts that identify them as such. You can also ask at the registration table or NumFOCUS booth to speak to PyData staff.</p>

<p>At PyData meetups, ask to speak to one of the meetup organizers.</p>

<p>In addition to contacting on-site event staff, NumFOCUS also encourages you to make a report using our reporting form, which goes to the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Enforcement Team.</p>

<p>If an incident takes place at an event or meetup, the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Enforcement Team will reach out to the relevant organizers/community managers/project leaders as necessary to follow up on the incident.</p>

<h2 id="code-of-conduct-highlights-specific-to-numfocus-events">Code of Conduct Highlights Specific to NumFOCUS Events</h2>
<p>We reproduce here certain portions of the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct that are specifically relevant to in-person events. We encourage all PyData participants to review the <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">complete Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reporting-at-events">Reporting at Events</h3>
<p>If you are at a NumFOCUS event and wish to make a report, please reach out to the event staff/meetup organizers so that they can take any appropriate immediate response.</p>

<p>Please additionally file a report with NumFOCUS <a href="https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/ynjGdT">here</a>.</p>

<p>Event staff/meetup organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.</p>

<p>Event-specific reporting instructions may be found on the website for the event. Meetup-specific reporting instructions should be found on the Meetup group’s page. Reporting instructions should also be announced and/or posted at the event/meetup itself.</p>

<p>Our ability to address any code of conduct breaches in a timely and effective manner is impacted by the amount of information you can provide, so our reporting form asks you to include as much of the following information as you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Your contact info</strong> (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up). This will be kept confidential. If you wish to remain anonymous, your information will not be shared beyond the person receiving the initial report.</li>
  <li><strong>The approximate time and location</strong> of the incident (please be as specific as possible)</li>
  <li><strong>Identifying information</strong> (e.g. name, nickname, screen name, physical description) of the individual whose behavior is being reported</li>
  <li><strong>Description of the behavior</strong> (if reporting harassing language, please be specific about the words used), your account of what happened, and any available supporting records (e.g. email, GitHub issue, screenshots, etc.)</li>
  <li><strong>Description of the circumstances/context</strong> surrounding the incident. Let us know if the incident is ongoing, and/or if this is part of an ongoing pattern of behavior</li>
  <li><strong>Names and contact info</strong>, if possible, of anyone else who witnessed or was involved in this incident. (Did anyone else observe the incident?)</li>
  <li>Any other relevant information you believe we should have</li>
</ul>

<p>Event staff/meetup organizers will attempt to gather and write down the above information from anyone making a verbal report. Recording the details in writing is exceedingly important in order for us to effectively respond to reports. If event staff write down a report taken verbally, then the person making the report will be asked to review the written report for accuracy.</p>

<p>NumFOCUS and/or our event staff will attempt to ensure your safety and help with any immediate needs, particularly at an in-person event.</p>

<p>At NumFOCUS events, if a participant engages in behavior that violates the code of conduct, the conference organizers and staff may take any action they deem appropriate.</p>

<p>Potential consequences for violating the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct at an in-person event include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Warning the person to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in sanctions</li>
  <li>Requiring that the person avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, the person they are harassing for the remainder of the event</li>
  <li>Ending a talk that violates the policy early</li>
  <li>Not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy</li>
  <li>Not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at the event now or in the future</li>
  <li>Immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the reported person holds</li>
  <li>Requiring that the person not volunteer for future events NumFOCUS runs (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)</li>
  <li>Expelling the person from the event without a refund</li>
  <li>Requiring that the person immediately leave the event and not return</li>
  <li>Banning the person from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)</li>
  <li>Any other response that NumFOCUS deems necessary and appropriate to the situation</li>
</ul>
