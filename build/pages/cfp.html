<p><em>If you haven’t read the guidelines below, please do so before submitting your talk. They contain the details of the application process as well as crucial information for submitting a successful proposal.</em></p>

<h1 id="deadlines">Deadlines</h1>

<p><strong>The deadline for the general CFP is August 2nd.</strong> Proposals submitted by this deadline will receive a decision in mid-August. The extended CFP deadline is August 16th. Proposals submitted during the extended CFP will be considered for a second round of acceptances.</p>

<p>Please note: <strong>Proposals submitted during the general CFP will be given priority. Proposals submitted after August 2nd will be less likely to be selected for the conference, as we will fill at least 80% of our schedule from the general CFP. Proposals submitted during the extended CFP will also receive later notice of acceptance, leaving less time to prepare and record your presentation.</strong></p>

<h1 id="english-language-review">English language review</h1>

<p>If you do not feel comfortable writing in English, you may email your proposal to <a href="mailto:global-proposal-review@pydata.org">global-proposal-review@pydata.org</a> for an initial language review before submitting it. This review will be carried out separately from proposal review, by a different group of people. Reviewers will not judge your writing style, grammar, or spelling. Proposals emailed before July 31st will receive feedback before August 2nd, and those sent after July 31st will receive it before August 14th. Thereby, you will be able to submit your proposal on time.</p>

<h1 id="why-pydata-global">Why PyData Global?</h1>

<p>PyData Global 2020 will be a first-of-its-kind virtual/hybrid event to promote open source scientific computing, acting in place of several long-established flagship events which would otherwise have been held in-person this year; namely, PyData London, PyData Delhi, PyData NYC, PyData Berlin, and PyData Los Angeles. <strong>Please read the CFP closely and in full.</strong></p>

<p>PyData is the fundraising and educational outreach arm of NumFOCUS, and proposals should have some identifiable linkage to the analysis, interpretation, storage, or processing of data. Python, R, Julia, and other languages in the data science stack are welcome. Use of open source tools and licensing is highly encouraged. All proposals and content submitted must adhere to the <a href="code_of_conduct.html">NumFOCUS Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond this broad mandate, the theme of this year’s event is <em>“Open Code, Better Science”</em>. Our goal is to identify content that not only highlights open source tools and their applications (“open code”) but also makes space in the global conversation for how to do “better science”. While we don’t expect that every proposal will cover real-world applications, doing Better Science demands that open source tools and methods make scientific computing more diverse, accessible, reproducible, inclusive, impactful, and sustainable. Please consider how you may incorporate elements of the theme into your proposal.</p>

<p>We seek submissions from analysts, scientists, developers, engineers, architects and others from the data science community from industry, government, and academia in the following formats:</p>

<h2 id="talks">Talks</h2>

<p>30-minute pre-recorded session. These will be made available to attendees to watch at their own pace ahead of the conference. You should expect to synchronously “attend” two (2) 20-minute live Q&amp;A sessions with attendees to accommodate viewers in different time zones.</p>

<p>If you feel your talk will fit in one of the specialized tracks for the conference, you will have the opportunity to indicate this on the proposal submission. Fitting with the theme of the event, the specialized tracks this year are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Causal and Statistical Methods</li>
  <li>Data Visualization &amp; Interpretability</li>
  <li>Julia for Python Users &amp; Julia Users</li>
  <li>Data Science in Production</li>
  <li>Lessons from Industry</li>
  <li>Open Science</li>
  <li>Algorithmic Accountability</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="short-talks">Short Talks</h2>

<p>Minimum 5 minute / maximum 10 minute pre-recorded session to fill a 15-minute time slot. You will be expected to synchronously “attend” your talk, during which time the audience can submit questions via live chat. A moderator will help you source and prioritize questions from the chat to answer during the 5-10 min live Q&amp;A session.</p>

<p>This format is ideal for sharing a quick demo of something you built, lessons learned from specific use cases, or “What’s new in X”-type new releases on NumFOCUS libraries.</p>

<h2 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h2>

<p>60-90 minute pre-recorded session to fill a 120-minute time slot. You and at least one other co-Presenter or Teaching Assistant (TA) named in your proposal will be expected to synchronously “attend” your talk, during which attendees can pause your video, repeat steps, work independently, and seek additional hands-on support from you or a TA in completing the tutorial exercises.</p>

<p>Tutorials should cover a well-defined topic in a hands-on manner, geared towards helping new or advanced programmers develop better or faster using the NumFOCUS scientific computing stack and related tools or techniques. Unlike a talk, tutorials must be designed to allow at least 50% of the time for hands-on exercises, even if this means the subject matter needs to be limited.</p>

<p>You must provide a Github repository and/or Binder to share with attendees in advance and note whether any pre-work (such as environment set up) is needed beforehand. If these materials already exist, please provide the link in your proposal.</p>

<h2 id="sprints">Sprints</h2>

<p>If you are a maintainer of an open source project, indicate whether you would like to organize either an “all-levels” (first-time and returning - this is recommended!) or “returning contributor only” sprint.</p>

<p>You and at least one other Maintainer or Teaching Assistant (TA) named in your proposal will be expected to synchronously “attend” the sprint for its duration, flexibly timed up to 4 hours in duration (indicate if fewer). Also plan to set aside some time ahead of the sprint to curate good “Easy” and/or “First time” issues.</p>

<p>Indicate in your proposal the maximum number of attendees you can accommodate, and share a link to any materials you already have prepared or outline what preparatory materials you will be able to provide ahead of the sprint, such as instructions on how to set up the developer environment, run tests, or submit a pull request.</p>

<h2 id="posters">Posters</h2>

<p>Posters will be available for viewing by conference attendees for the duration of PyData Global, and you will be expected to attend a poster session during which time conference attendees can drop-in to ask you questions about your research and/or use case.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>We are asking all speakers to commit to presenting at PyData Global 2020 if their proposals are accepted.</strong> This commitment will greatly simplify the Program Committee’s deliberations and will enable us to communicate acceptances and bring together the conference program much more quickly.</p>

<p>Whether you are new to technical speaking in general, or new to the PyData community, first-time speakers are especially welcome. Please indicate this on your proposal. Mentoring resources may also be available to both first-time and returning speakers on a limited basis.</p>

<p>Recognizing that our community represents a wide variety of professional backgrounds and experiences, content should target a broad technical audience who may have related but not specific experience in the libraries or methods covered in your talk. More advanced submissions are welcome but should indicate any recommended prerequisites. Novice level content should be geared towards motivated beginners.</p>

<p>Although you may submit multiple proposals, you can expect a maximum of one acceptance per category.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>

<h2 id="when-will-i-receive-a-decision-for-my-proposal">When will I receive a decision for my proposal?</h2>

<p>Proposals submitted by the general deadline (August 2nd) will receive a decision by mid-August. Proposals submitted during the extended CFP will receive a decision in late August or early September.</p>

<h2 id="when-will-talk-recordings-be-due">When will talk recordings be due?</h2>

<p>Recordings will be due in mid-October.</p>

<h2 id="if-accepted-what-do-i-get">If accepted, what do I get?</h2>

<p>Anyone selected to speak/present/host from the categories above will receive a free, all-access pass to PyData Global 2020 live and asynchronous events plus materials. Talks and tutorials will be made publicly available on an official PyData platform (such as YouTube) after the event. Sprints are encouraged to track and report the number of PRs opened/merged during the event, and we will work with you to create a blog post or other similarly lasting artifact of the event.</p>

<h2 id="does-my-proposal-need-to-represent-english-language-content">Does my proposal need to represent English-language content?</h2>

<p>Running a multilingual conference is very challenging. Translation is expensive, and we lack the necessary connections to serve communities that share our interest in open scientific computing but do not communicate using English.</p>

<p>Instead, we envision a PyData Global where attendees can meaningfully interact with every single session through written English. This will relax the existing language barrier of PyData events, which require spoken English for participation. As we gain greater certainty in our budget, we will consider further measures that lower the proficiency requirement further, such as close captioning for talks.</p>

<p>Submissions in other languages will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and if accepted these will be facilitated with English translation captions.</p>

<h2 id="does-my-proposal-have-to-be-written-in-english">Does my proposal have to be written in English?</h2>

<p>If you are submitting content for a language other than English, please still provide your abstract/description in English. If accepted, you will also need to provide the description in the target language for the program.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-tags">What are tags?</h2>

<p>For Talks, Short Talks, Posters, and Tutorials, please “tag” your proposal with all relevant Topic tags, in order to help us assign your proposal for review.</p>

<h2 id="my-company-wants-to-sponsor-can-i-introduce-them-to-you">My company wants to sponsor. Can I introduce them to you?</h2>

<p>Yes! Please indicate this on your application. This will have no bearing on the consideration or likelihood of acceptance of your proposal, but it will help us identify and source leads for sponsorship, which helps support open source and educational outreach in order to advance the <a href="https://numfocus.org/community/mission">mission of NumFOCUS</a>. You may also share our <a href="https://numfocus.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NumFOCUS-Corporate-Sponsorship-Brochure-Apr-2020-2.pdf">sponsorship prospectus</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-will-i-record">How will I record?</h2>

<p>We will work with all of our accepted speakers to ensure that their audio and video are high quality, and we aim to provide audio and video recording equipment if needed. In your proposal, you can indicate if you need audio and/or video recording equipment.</p>

<h2 id="do-speakers-receive-payment-in-exchange-for-speaking">Do speakers receive payment in exchange for speaking?</h2>

<p>We will have a number of modest speaker stipends available based on need; the quantity available will depend on successful sponsorship of this effort. If a stipend would make a difference in your ability to prepare and record your material, and participate in live Q&amp;A, you can indicate that you would like to be considered for these funds through the CFP. Proposal selection is need-blind; asking to be considered for need-based stipends will have no bearing on the consideration or likelihood of acceptance of your proposal.</p>

<h2 id="are-speakers-able-to-attend-the-full-conference-for-free">Are speakers able to attend the full conference for free?</h2>

<p>Yes! Presenting a talk, tutorial, sprint, or poster entitles you to an all-access conference pass.</p>

<h2 id="are-there-any-additional-resources-for-first-time-speakers">Are there any additional resources for first time speakers?</h2>

<p>Yes. We have reserved a limited number of spots on the schedule specifically for “mentored talks.” Mentored talks are talks wholly conceived by and presented by first-time speakers, under the guidance/mentorship of the PyData Program Committee. Indicate your interest in your proposal.</p>

<h2 id="is-there-an-in-person-component-to-this-event">Is there an in-person component to this event?</h2>

<p>Where restrictions on gatherings have been lifted, we will work with local PyData communities to organize in-person watch parties closer to the event.</p>

<h2 id="if-my-proposal-is-accepted-am-i-obligated-to-present">If my proposal is accepted, am I obligated to present?</h2>

<p>Yes, we ask that you commit to presenting if your proposal is accepted. If you are unable to commit to presenting if your proposal is accepted, we regretfully must ask that you not submit a proposal this time. Of course, if extenuating circumstances arise and you are not able to present your accepted talk/tutorial, please let us know as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="is-the-proposal-selection-process-double-blind">Is the proposal selection process double-blind?</h2>

<p>No, proposal selection will be double-open. This means reviewers will be able to see your name on your proposal(s) and you will be able to see theirs.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-have-any-tips-on-how-to-prepare-the-proposal">Do you have any tips on how to prepare the proposal?</h2>

<p>Yes, see here for <a href="cfp_tips.html">some general guidance</a>, adapted from PyData London.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-conferences-hashtag">What’s the conference’s hashtag?</h2>

<p>Great question. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyDataGlobal2020">#PyDataGlobal2020</a>. Maybe consider sharing this CFP on social media?</p>

<hr />

<p>Thank you so much for considering submitting to PyData Global! We are looking forward to reading your proposal, and appreciate you being a part of our community. If you got this far, please submit and encourage your colleagues / coworkers / to submit as well!</p>
